# Regional Pricing Strategy Optimization

## Business Problem
Unilever operates across multiple European regions with differing cost structures,
brand strength, and margin targets. This project evaluates current pricing logic,
identifies regional misalignments, and predicts optimal prices using data analytics
and machine learning.

## Dataset
- Unilever pricing dataset (Excel)
- finance margin targets (Excel)

## Tools & Technologies
- Excel (initial pricing logic)
- SQL (data querying)
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Visualization (Matplotlib)
- Statistics (SciPy)
- Machine Learning (Scikit-learn)

## Project Workflow
1. Data ingestion and cleaning
2. Feature engineering
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Statistical testing (t-tests, regression)
5. Machine learning (price prediction & premium classification)
6. Executive recommendations

## Key Insights
- Statistically significant price differences exist across regions
- Brand strength is a strong driver of recommended price
- Certain regions under-monetize margin targets

## Business Recommendations
- Introduce region-specific pricing bands
- Use ML-based guidance for new product pricing
- Apply probability thresholds for premium positioning
